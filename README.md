# Noir workshop for Verfiable Summit


## ZK Intuitions: Thinking like a Circuit

In this workshop, we will go through some differences between regular functional programming with Rust and circuit programming with Noir. We will explore the Alibaba cave in more detail - for each intuition, we'll explore what it might look like in Rust and then fix it to work in Noir.

You can find the workshop slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IQeb5c4W7kCc0ep6W1Pw0vZuD2Sv62Wi9rSUr6lxtcM/edit?usp=sharing).
